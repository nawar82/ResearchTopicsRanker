# Eutilities (NCBI API)
This is the tool to interact with the different databases.
We are interested in the beginning in interacting with two of them, esearch and efetch.
esearch returns both json and xml and we can use it to get the UIDs of the search terms in pubmed
efetch supports only xml and will get the UIDs list and report back the abstracts (among other info if needed)
