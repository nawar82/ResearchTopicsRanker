However, it remains to be determined whether these associations are causal or not. The aim of this study was to investigate the underlying causal association between different thyroid function status and PCOS.Bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was conducted to explore the impact of different thyroid function statuses on PCOS. The study included 10,074 individuals with PCOS and 103,164 controls for the primary analysis, with validation analysis repeated in the FinnGen R9 and EstBB PCOS cohorts. Female-specific thyroid function GWAS data were obtained from European population, including Hyperthyroidism (22,383 cases and 54,288 controls) and Hypothyroidism (27,383 cases and 54,288 controls) from the UK Biobank, and TSH (54,288 cases and 72,167 controls) and FT4 (49,269 cases and 72,167 controls) within the reference range from the ThyroidOmics Consortium. Inverse variance weighting (IVW) was chosen as the principal method, and sensitivity analysis was conducted to test for the presence of horizontal pleiotropy or heterogeneity.The IVW analysis indicated nominal significance between normal TSH levels and PCOS after adjusted for age and BMI [OR (95% CI)\\u2009=\\u20090.78(0.62,0.97), P\\u2009=\\u20090.029], suggesting that maintaining normal TSH levels might act as a protective factor against the pathogenesis of PCOS. Besides, in order to increase the statistical power, we pooled PCOS GWAS above together by meta-analysis and found PCOS contributed to the occurrence of hyperthyroidism [OR(95%CI)\\u2009=\\u20091.37(0.73,2.57), P\\u2009=\\u20090.012]. However, no causal relationship was found after Bonferroni correction (P-value\\u2009<\\u20090.0031).Although the MR analysis didn't indicate genetic causal association between thyroid function and PCOS after Bonferroni correction. Further efforts are needed to interpret the potential causal relationship between thyroid function and PCOS in different age and BMI subgroup.© 2024.

Several techniques were used to ensure the stability of the causal effect, such as random-effect inverse variance weighted, weighted median, MR-Egger regression, and MR-PRESSO. Heterogeneity was evaluated by calculating Cochran's Q value. Moreover, the presence of horizontal pleiotropy was investigated through MR-Egger regression and MR-PRESSO.The IVW method indicates a causal relationship between both GD(OR 1.31,95%CI 1.08 to 1.60,P=0.005) and autoimmune hypothyroidism (OR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.08 to 1.47, P =0.002) with MG. However, there is no association found between FT4(OR 0.88,95%CI 0.65 to 1.18,P=0.406), TPOAb(OR: 1.34, 95% CI: 0.86 to 2.07, P =0.186), TSH(OR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.77 to 1.23, P =0.846), and MG. The reverse MR analysis reveals a causal relationship between MG and GD(OR: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.14 to 1.98, P =3.57e-3), with stable results. On the other hand, there is a significant association with autoimmune hypothyroidism(OR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.59, P =0.019), but it is considered unstable due to the influence of horizontal pleiotropy (MR PRESSO Distortion Test P < 0.001). MG has a higher prevalence of TPOAb(OR: 1.84, 95% CI: 1.39 to 2.42, P =1.47e-5) positivity and may be linked to elevated TSH levels(Beta:0.08,95% CI:0.01 to 0.14,P =0.011), while there is no correlation between MG and FT4(Beta:-9.03e-3,95% CI:-0.07 to 0.05,P =0.796).AITD patients are more susceptible to developing MG, and MG patients also have a higher incidence of GD.Copyright © 2024 Wang, Wang, Chen, Chen and Lin.\",\n",

The objective of this paper was to employ Two-Sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis to investigate the connections between three thyroid diseases and thyroid hormone indicators with viral pneumonia and COVID-19. We obtained summary statistics datasets from seven genome-wide association studies (GWASs). The primary method used for estimating relationships was inverse-variance weighting (IVW). In addition, we employed weighted median, weighted mode, MR-Egger, and MR-PRESSO as supplementary analytical tools. Sensitivity analyses encompassed Cochran's Q test, MR-Egger intercept test, and MR-PRESSO. Our study revealed significant causal relationships between having a genetic predisposition to autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) and an increased susceptibility to viral pneumonia (odds ratio [OR]: 1.096; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.022-1.176). Moreover, it demonstrated a heightened susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 (OR for COVID-19 susceptibility, COVID-19 hospitalization, and COVID-19 critical illness, with 95% CIs of 1.016, 1.001-1.032; 1.058, 1.003-1.116; 1.045, 1.010-1.081). However, no statistically significant associations were found between TSH, FT4, subclinical hypo- or hyperthyroidism, and the risk of viral pneumonia incidence, or the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 (all p > 0.05). This study establishes a cause-and-effect relationship between AITD and the development of viral pneumonia, as well as the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19.\",\n",

The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism were obtained from the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the IEU database, including 337,159 subjects. Data for fT4 and TSH (72,167 subjects) were extracted from the ThyroidOmics Consortium. ARC was used as the outcome. The SNPs associated with ARC were selected from a GWAS of 216,362 individuals in the FinnGen database. The main method used was the inverse variance-weighted method, together with four complementary methods. Sensitivity analyses were performed using Cochran's Q test, MR-PRESSO, MR-Egger regression and leave-one-out test. MR pleiotropy was used to test for pleiotropy. MR Steiger test was used to test for the directionality.Two-sample MR analysis revealed a positive association between genetically predicted hypothyroidism and risk of ARC (OR = 2.501, 95% CI: 1.325-4.720; P = 0.004). Hyperthyroidism, circulating fT4 and TSH levels did not have a significant causal effect on ARC (P > 0.05). The results were robust and reliable, and no horizontal pleiotropy was found after sensitivity analyses. In the MR Steiger test, we found no reverse causal effects of hypothyroidism on the ARC (P <0.001).Our study provides strong evidence that hypothyroidism is a causal determinant of ARC risk.Copyright © 2024 Liu, Sun, Gu, Bao, Wang, Qin and Yuan.\",\n",

However, whether the causation exists is unclear, and controversy remains about which specific disorder, such as hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, is destructive in TMDs. This study aims to investigate the overall and specific causal effects of various thyroid conditions on TMDs.Mendelian randomization (MR) studies were performed using genetic instruments for thyrotropin (TSH, N\\u2009=\\u2009119,715), free thyroxine (fT4, N\\u2009=\\u200949,269), hypothyroidism (N\\u2009=\\u2009410,141), hyperthyroidism (N\\u2009=\\u2009460,499), and TMDs (N\\u2009=\\u2009211,023). We assessed the overall effect of each thyroid factor via inverse-variance weighted (IVW), weighted median, and MR-Egger methods, and performed extensive sensitivity analyses. Additionally, multivariable MR was conducted to evaluate the direct or indirect effects of hypothyroidism on TMDs whilst accounting for TSH, fT4 and hyperthyroidism, and vice versa.Univariable MR analyses revealed a causal effect of hypothyroidism on an increased risk of TMDs (IVW OR: 1.12, 95% CI: 1.05-1.20, p\\u2009=\\u20090.001). No significant association between genetically predicted hyperthyroidism, TSH, or fT4 and TMDs. In the multivariable MR analyses, the effects of hypothyroidism on TMDs occurrence remained significant even after adjSusting for TSH, fT4 and hyperthyroidism (multivariable IVW OR: 1.10, 95% CI: 1.03-1.17, p\\u2009=\\u20090.006). No pleiotropy and heterogeneity were detected in the analyses (p\\u2009>\\u20090.05).Hypothyroidism might causally increase the risk of TMDs through a direct pathway, highlighting the critical role of managing thyroid health in the prevention of TMDs. Clinicians should give heightened attention to patients with hypothyroidism when seeking medical advice for temporomandibular discomfort. However, caution is warranted due to the potential confounders, pleiotropy, and selection bias in the MR study.© 2024. The Author(s).',\n",

We report a genome-wide association study meta-analysis of thyroid function in up to 271,040 individuals of European ancestry, including reference range thyrotropin (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4), free and total triiodothyronine (T3), proxies for metabolism (T3/FT4 ratio) as well as dichotomized high and low TSH levels. We revealed 259 independent significant associations for TSH (61% novel), 85 for FT4 (67% novel), and 62 novel signals for the T3 related traits. The loci explained 14.1%, 6.0%, 9.5% and 1.1% of the total variation in TSH, FT4, total\\xa0T3 and free\\xa0T3 concentrations, respectively. Genetic correlations indicate that TSH associated loci reflect the thyroid function determined by free\\xa0T3, whereas the FT4 associations represent the thyroid hormone metabolism. Polygenic risk score and Mendelian randomization analyses showed the effects of genetically determined variation in thyroid function on various clinical outcomes, including cardiovascular risk factors and diseases, autoimmune diseases, and cancer.

These findings were robust and consistent through sensitivity analysis with other MR models.This bidirectional MR reveals periodontitis should not be attributed to variations in thyroid function but it has potential causal effect on hypothyroidism risk, which provides a better understanding of the relationship between periodontitis and thyroid function, and potential evidence for the clinical intervention of hypothyroidism.

       "  'Abstract': \"Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are observationally associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but causality is unclear. To evaluate the causal relationship between thyroid function and RA, we conducted a two-Sample bidirectional Mendelian Randomization (MR) study.Single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with six phenotypes were selected from the FinnGen biobank database, The ThyroidOmics Consortium database, and the IEU Open GWAS database. For the forward MR analysis, we selected hypothyroidism (N=213,390), Graves' disease (GD) (N=199,034), other types of hyperthyroidism (N=190,799), free thyroxine (FT4, N=49,269), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH, N=54,288) as the five related thyroid function phenotypes for exposure, with RA (N=58,284) as the outcome. Reverse MR analysis selected RA as the exposure and five phenotypes of thyroid function as the outcome. The Inverse variance weighting (IVW) method was used as the primary analysis method, supplemented by weighted median (WM) and MR-Egger methods. Cochran's Q test, MR-PRESSO, MR-Egger regression methods, and leave-one-out analysis were employed to assess sensitivity and pleiotropy.Forward MR evidence indicates that genetic susceptibility to hypothyroidism is associated with an increased risk of RA (ORIvw=1.758, P=7.61×10-5). Reverse MR evidence suggests that genetic susceptibility to RA is associated with an increased risk of hypothyroidism (ORIvw=1.274, P=3.88×10-20), GD (ORIvw=1.269, P=8.15×10-05), and other types of hyperthyroidism (ORIvw=1.141, P=1.80×10-03). There is no evidence to support a forward or reverse causal relationship between genetic susceptibility to RA and FT4, TSH.Our results provide genetic evidence supporting bidirectional causal relationships between thyroid function and RA. These findings inform preventive strategies and interventions targeting RA and thyroid dysfunction.Copyright © 2023 Gu, Pu, Ma, Yue, Xin, Li, Liu, Zheng and Ouyang.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Observational studies have indicated a potential association between thyroid dysfunction and the risk of sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL). However, the precise causal relationship between the two remains uncertain. The objective of our study was to assess the causal influence of thyroid function on SSNHL by employing a bidirectional and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR) approach.Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with free thyroid (FT4) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) were selected from the summary data of a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) conducted on European individuals. The summary-level data of SSNHL were also obtained from a GWAS, which included 196,592 participants (1,491 cases and 195,101 controls). The MR analysis primarily utilized the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method, with sensitivity analyses performed using the weighted median, MR-Egger, and MR-PRESSO approaches.In the IVW method, an elevated genetically predicted FT4 level was found to effectively reduce the risk of SSNHL (OR = 0.747, 95% CI = 0.565-0.987, P = 0.04). These findings were consistent when conducting multivariate MR analysis, which adjusted for TSH levels (OR = 0.929, 95% CI = 0.867-0.995, P = 0.036). However, genetically predicted TSH levels did not emerge as a risk factor for SSNHL (OR = 1.409, 95% CI = 0.895-1.230, P = 0.547). Furthermore, even after adjusting for FT4 levels in the multivariate MR analysis, no evidence of a direct causal relationship between TSH levels and the risk of SSNHL was observed (OR = 1.011, 95% CI = 0.880-1.161, P = 0.867). The reverse MR analysis showed that there was no evidence of a direct causal relationship between SSNHL and the risk of FT4 level (OR = 1.026, 95% CI = 0.999-1.054, P = 0.056) or TSH level (OR = 1.002, 95% CI = 0.989-1.015, P = 0.702).Within the normal range, genetic variants associated with higher FT4 levels demonstrate a potential protective effect against SSNHL, whereas there is no direct causal relationship between TSH levels and the risk of SSNHL.Copyright © 2023 Chen, Wu, He, Wu, Yang, Zhong and Luo.',\n",

However, the causal relationship between PSC and TD remains uncertain. The purpose of this study is to investigate the causal associations and specific direction between these two conditions. Gaining insight into the potential causal relationship between PSC and TD is valuable for elucidating the pathogenesis of PSC and for devising innovative approaches for the prevention and treatment of PSC and its associated complications.We conducted a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to investigate the causal association between PSC and TD, such as autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD), thyroid cancer (TC), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), among others. PSC was the exposure variable, while TD was the outcome variable. To identify suitable instrumental variables (IVs), we utilized genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets to select potential candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The primary statistical approach employed was the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method, which was complemented by a series of sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the results by estimating heterogeneity and pleiotropy.We found that the causal associations between genetically predicted PSC and Graves' disease (GD), hyperthyroidism (IVW OR=1.230, 95%CI: 1.089-1.389, P=0.001; IVW OR=1.001, 95%CI: 1.000-1.002, P=0.000) were statistically significant. The reverse MR analysis indicated that genetic susceptibility to hyperthyroidism (P=0.000) and hypothyroidism (p=0.028) might be the risk of PSC. There was no statistically significant causal association observed between PSC and other TD (IVW P>0.05), with the exception of GD, hyperthyroidism, and hypothyroidism as determined through bidirectional two-sample analysis. To ensure the reliability of our findings, additional sensitivity analyses were conducted, including the leave-one-out (LOO) test, heterogeneity test, and pleiotropic test.In this study, we conducted an investigation into the causal association between PSC and TD. Our findings indicate that PSC significantly elevates the susceptibility to GD and hyperthyroidism from a statistical perspective. These results shed light on the etiology of PSC and have implications for the management of patients with PSC.Copyright © 2023 Zhang and Lang.\",\n",

Data from the Thyroidomics Consortium on 72,167 individuals were used to assess genetically determined thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4). Lung cancer, lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell lung cancer GWAS data from the International Lung Cancer Consortium(ILCCO). Six different Mendelian randomization (MR) Methods, including Inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, Simple mode, MR-Pleiotropy Residual Sum and Outlier methods (MR-PRESSO), Weighted mode and Weighted median were used to Two-Sample MR analysis. IVW was used as the primary estimate. Sensitivity analyses were examined via four aspects (Cochran's Q-test, MR Egger intercept analysis, Funnel plot and Leave-one-out sensitivity test).The OR of hypothyroidism on lung cancer was 0.918 (95% CI, 0.859-0.982; p\\u2009=\\u20090.013) in MR analysis with IVW method. No evidence for effects of hyperthyroidism, TSH and FT4 on lung cancer risk was found via six MR methods. Meanwhile, there was no evidence for effects of lung cancer on hypothyroidism through six MR methods. Lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell lung carcinoma were further analyzed on the basis of lung cancer. The OR of hypothyroidism on lung adenocarcinoma was 0.893(95% CI, 0.813-0.981; p\\u2009=\\u20090.019), the OR of hypothyroidism on squamous cell lung cancer was 0.888(95%CI,0.797-0.990, p\\u2009=\\u20090.032) in MR analysis with IVW method.In summary, hypothyroidism genetically had a protective causal association with lung cancer.

       "  'Abstract': 'Schizophrenia is a chronic psychiatric disorder with inconsistent behavioral and cognitive abnormalities with profound effects on the individual and the society. Individuals with schizophrenia have altered thyroid function, but results from observational studies are conflicting. To date, it remains unclear whether and in which direction there is a causal relationship between thyroid function and schizophrenia. To investigate causal paths, a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study was conducted using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies including up to 330,132 Europeans. Thyroid function was described by the normal-range thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine levels as well as an increased and decreased TSH status. The iterative radial inverse-variance weighted approach with modified second order weights was used as the main method. Based on a discovery and replication sample for schizophrenia, pooled effect estimates were derived using a fixed-effect meta-analysis. Robustness of results was assessed using both a range of pleiotropy robust methods and a network analysis that clustered genetic instruments potentially responsible for horizontal pleiotropy. Genetic liability for hypothyroidism was inversely associated with schizophrenia ([Formula: see text]; 95% CI: (-0.10; -0.02); [Formula: see text]). No notable associations were observed between other thyroid parameters and schizophrenia. Furthermore, no associations could be detected in the reverse direction. Our results suggest that an elevated level of TSH reduce the risk for schizophrenia. The role of thyroid function and the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis in the development of schizophrenia should be subject of further research.© 2023. The Author(s).',\n",

This study aims to investigate whether thyrotropin (TSH), free thyroxine (fT4), hypo- and hyperthyroidism are causally linked to AMH levels.We obtained summary statistics from three sources: the ThyroidOmics Consortium (N = 54,288), HUNT + MGI + ThyroidOmics meta-analysis (N = 119,715), and the most recent AMH genome-wide association meta-analysis (N = 7,049). Two-sample MR analyses were conducted using instrumental variables representing TSH and fT4 levels within the normal range. Additionally, we conducted secondary analyses to explore the effects of hypo- and hyperthyroidism. Subgroup analyses for TSH were also performed.MR analyses did not show any causality relationship between thyroid function and AMH levels, using normal range TSH, normal range fT4, subclinical hypothyroidism, subclinical hyperthyroidism and overt hypothyroidism as exposure, respectively. In addition, neither full range TSH nor TSH with individuals <50 years old was causally associated with AMH levels.

Genome-wide association study statistics for thyroid-related phenotypes were obtained from the ThyroidOmics consortium, and summary statistics for genetic associations with CRC were obtained from the FinnGen consortium.

We chose the multiplicative random effects inverse variance weighted (IVW) method as the main analysis. Sensitivity analysis included weighted median and mode analysis, as well as MR-Egger and Causal Analysis Using Summary Effect estimates (CAUSE).Our results suggest that higher fT4 levels lower the risk of developing MetS (OR = 0.96, P = .037). Genetically predicted fT4 was also positively associated with HDL-C (β = 0.02, P = .008), while genetically predicted TSH was positively associated with TG (β = 0.01, P = .044). These effects were consistent across different MR analyses and confirmed with the CAUSE analysis. In the reverse direction MR analysis, genetically predicted HDL-C was negatively associated with TSH (β = -0.03, P = .046) in the main IVW analysis.Our study suggests that variations in normal-range thyroid function are causally associated with the diagnosis of MetS and with lipid profile, while in the reverse direction, HDL-C has a plausible causal effect on reference-range TSH levels.© The Author(s) 2023.

A multivariable analysis was conducted to assess the mediating role of smoking and help to explain the association between EA and thyroid function. Similar analysis was further performed using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999 to 2002.In MR analysis, EA was causally associated with TSH (β = .046; 95% CI, 0.015-0.077; P = 4.00 × 10-3), rather than hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and FT4. Importantly, smoking could serve as a mediator in the association between EA and TSH, in which the mediating proportion was estimated to be 10.38%. After adjusting for smoking in the multivariable MR analysis, the β value of EA on TSH was attenuated to 0.030 (95% CI, 0.016-0.045; P = 9.32 × 10-3). Multivariable logistic regression model in NHANES suggested a dose-response relationship between TSH (quartile [Q]4 vs Q1: odds ratio = 1.33; 95% CI, 1.05-1.68; P for trend = .023) and EA. Smoking, systolic blood pressure, and body mass index partially mediated the association between EA and TSH, with the proportion of the mediation effects being 43.82%, 12.28%, and 6.81%, respectively.There is a potentially causal association between EA and TSH, which could be mediated by several risk factors, such as smoking.© The Author(s) 2023.

We tested the hypothesis that TSH on a continuous scale is associated with risk of atrial fibrillation (AF), myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, heart failure (HF), aortic valve stenosis (AVS), and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and whether these associations are likely to be causal.We first tested whether plasma TSH on a continuous scale was observationally associated with incident cardiovascular events in a prospective cohort study of 105,224 individuals from the Copenhagen General Population Study followed for a median 7 years. Next, we tested whether a genetic risk score weighted on TSH was associated with cardiovascular endpoints. Finally, using Mendelian randomization, we tested whether the observed associations were likely to be causal.Using restricted cubic splines, lower concentrations of TSH relative to the population median (=1.53 mIU/L) were associated with higher risk of AF, MI, stroke, HF, AVS, and MACE. Comparing individuals with TSH ≤5th percentile (≤0.54 mIU/L) versus >50th percentile (>1.53 mIU/L), hazard ratios (HRs) ranged from 1.12 (1.00-1.26) for stroke to 1.27 (1.11-1.46) for HF. Genetic risk estimates per standard deviation decrease in TSH were 1.28 (1.08-1.52) for AF, 1.35 (1.06-1.71) for MI, 1.06 (0.89-1.26) for stroke, 1.19 (0.94-1.52) for HF, 1.53 (1.03-2.26) for AVS, and 1.09 (0.97-1.23) for MACE.In 105,224 individuals from the general population low plasma TSH was observationally and genetically associated with increased risk of AF, MI, and AVS suggesting that these observations may reflect causal pathways.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

Results for BPD such as prostatic hyperplasia (13,118 cases and 72,799 controls) and prostatitis (1,859 cases and 72,799 controls) were obtained from the FinnGen study. The causal relationship between thyroid function and BPD was primarily assessed using MR with an inverse variance weighted approach. In addition, sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the results.We found that TSH [OR (95% CI) = 0.912(0.845-0.984), p =1.8 x 10-2], subclinical hypothyroidism [OR (95% CI) = 0.864(0.810-0.922), p =1.04 x 10-5], and overt hypothyroidism [OR (95% CI) = 0.885 (0.831-0. 944), p =2 x 10-4] had a significant effect on genetic susceptibility to BPH, unlike hyperthyroidism [OR (95% CI) = 1.049(0.990-1.111), p =1.05 x 10-1] and FT4 [OR (95% CI) = 0.979(0.857-1.119), p = 7.59 x 10-1] had no effect.

Data for FT4 and TSH (72,167 subjects) were extracted from the ThyroidOmics Consortium. HV was used as the outcome. The SNPs associated with HV were selected from a GWAS of 202,617 individuals in the fignngen database. The inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was used as the primary analysis. Four complementary methods were applied, including MR-presso, MR-Egger, and weighted median. In addition, Cochran's Q test, MR-presso, MR-Egger regression, and the leave-one-out test were used as sensitivity analysis, and the MR-pleiotropy test was performed to examine pleiotropy.According to the results of IVW, we found that there was a causal relationship between hypothyroidism and HV, and hypothyroidism increased the incidence of HV (OR = 2.838 (95% CI: 1.116-7.213); p = 0.028). There were no significant causal effects of hyperthyroidism, FT4, and TSH on HV (p > 0.05).

However, it is unclear whether this association reflects a causal relationship.To assess the potential direct effect of thyroid characteristics on DKD and DR based on Mendelian randomization (MR).We conducted an MR study using genetic variants as an instrument associated with thyroid function to examine the causal effects on DKD and DR. The study included the analysis of 4 exposure factors associated with thyroid hormone regulation and 5 outcomes. Genomewide significant variants were used as instruments for standardized freethyroxine (FT4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels within the reference range, standardized free triiodothyronine (FT3):FT4 ratio, and standardized thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAB) levels. The primary outcomes were DKD and DR events, and secondary outcomes were estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) in diabetes, and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Satisfying the 3 MR core assumptions, the inverse-variance weighted technique was used as the primary analysis, and sensitivity analysis was performed using MR-Egger, weighted median, and MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier techniques.All outcome and exposure instruments were selected from publicly available GWAS data conducted in European populations. In inverse-variance weighted random-effects MR, gene-based TSH with in the reference range was associated with DKD (OR 1.44; 95%CI 1.04, 2.41; P = 0.033) and eGFR (β: -0.031; 95%CI: -0.063, -0.001; P = 0.047). Gene-based increased FT3:FT4 ratio, decreased FT4 with in the reference range were associated with increased ACR with inverse-variance weighted random-effects β of 0.178 (95%CI: 0.004, 0.353; P = 0.046) and -0.078 (95%CI: -0.142, -0.014; P = 0.017), respectively, and robust to tests of horizontal pleiotropy. However, all thyroid hormone instruments were not associated with DR and PDR at the genetic level.In diabetic patients, an elevated TSH within the reference range was linked to a greater risk of DKD and decreased eGFR. Similarly, decreased FT4 and an increased FT3:FT4 ratio within the reference range were associated with increased ACR in diabetic patients. However, gene-based thyroid hormones were not associated with DR, indicating a possible pathway involving the thyroid-islet-renal axis. However, larger population studies are needed to further validate this conclusion.Copyright © 2023 Li, Li, Dong, Zhang, Dong and Zhang.',\n",

The primary analysis was conducted by the inverse variance-weighted MR method, followed by sensitivity analyses using MR-PRESSO, MR-Egger, weighted median, and weighted mode methods.Genetically increased TSH was associated with increased MD (β = .311, 95% CI 0.0763, 0.548, P = .01). Genetically increased FT4 was associated with increased FA (β = .540, 95% CI 0.222, 0.858, P < .001). Sensitivity analyses using different MR methods showed similar directions but lower precision. No significant associations of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism with WMH, MD, or FA were found (all P > .05).This study indicated that genetically predicted increased TSH was associated with increased MD, as well as increased FT4 with increased FA, implying the causal effect of thyroid dysfunction on white matter microstructural injury. There were no significant causal relationships of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism with CSVD. Further investigations should verify these findings and clarify the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.© The Author(s) 2023.

       "  'Abstract': 'Background: Thyroid hormones play a key role in differentiation and metabolism and are known regulators of gene expression through both genomic and epigenetic processes including DNA methylation. The aim of this study was to examine associations between thyroid hormones and DNA methylation. Methods: We carried out a fixed-effect meta-analysis of epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of blood DNA methylation sites from 8 cohorts from the ThyroidOmics Consortium, incorporating up to 7073 participants of both European and African ancestry, implementing a discovery and replication stage. Statistical analyses were conducted using normalized beta CpG values as dependent and log-transformed thyrotropin (TSH), free thyroxine, and free triiodothyronine levels, respectively, as independent variable in a linear model. The replicated findings were correlated with gene expression levels in whole blood and tested for causal influence of TSH and free thyroxine by two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR). Results: Epigenome-wide significant associations (p-value <1.1E-7) of three CpGs for free thyroxine, five for free triiodothyronine, and two for TSH concentrations were discovered and replicated (combined p-values\\u2009=\\u20091.5E-9 to 4.3E-28). The associations included CpG sites annotated to KLF9 (cg00049440) and DOT1L (cg04173586) that overlap with all three traits, consistent with hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis physiology. Significant associations were also found for CpGs in FKBP5 for free thyroxine, and at CSNK1D/LINCO1970 and LRRC8D for free triiodothyronine. MR analyses supported a causal effect of thyroid status on DNA methylation of KLF9. DNA methylation of cg00049440 in KLF9 was inversely correlated with KLF9 gene expression in blood. The CpG at CSNK1D/LINC01970 overlapped with thyroid hormone receptor alpha binding peaks in liver cells. The total additive heritability of the methylation levels of the six significant CpG sites was between 25% and 57%. Significant methylation QTLs were identified for CpGs at KLF9, FKBP5, LRRC8D, and CSNK1D/LINC01970. Conclusions: We report novel associations between TSH, thyroid hormones, and blood-based DNA methylation. This study advances our understanding of thyroid hormone action particularly related to KLF9 and serves as a proof-of-concept that integrations of EWAS with other -omics data can provide a valuable tool for unraveling thyroid hormone signaling in humans by complementing and feeding classical in vitro and animal studies.',\n",

However, whether TSH levels are causally associated with the risk of mortality remains unclear.This study aims to investigate the causal association between TSH levels and all-cause mortality using Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses.MR analyses using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with TSH levels (P < 5 × 10-8) as instruments. Mortality data were obtained from the UK Biobank, including 384 344 participants who were recruited from 22 assessment centers across the UK taken between 2006 and 2010. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the association of the TSH genetic risk score (GRS) with all-cause and cause-specific mortality.15 557 individuals died during a median of 9.00 years of follow-up in the UK Biobank. A total of 70 SNPs were included in the MR analysis. The main MR analyses showed that 1 SD increase in TSH was associated with a decreased risk of all-cause mortality (OR 0.972, 95% CI 0.948-0.996), which may be largely attributed to respiratory disease mortality (OR 0.881, 95% CI 0.805-0.963). The multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) (95% CI) of all-cause mortality across 3 TSH GRS categories were 1.00 (reference), 0.976 (0.940-1.014), and 0.947 (0.911-0.985), respectively (P for trend < .01). Moreover, except digestive diseases mortality, genetically predicted TSH levels were negatively associated with mortality from CVD, cancer, noncancer diseases causes, and dementia, although not statistically significant.Higher TSH levels were causally associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality, which may be largely attributed to respiratory disease mortality.© The Author(s) 2023.

The association between SLE and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was further analyzed to help interpret the findings. In addition, findings were verified using a validation data set, as well as through different MR methods with different model assumptions.The linkage disequilibrium score regression revealed a shared genetic structure between SLE and primary hypothyroidism, with the significant genetic correlation estimated to be 0.2488 (P = 6.00 × 10-4). MR analysis with the inverse variance weighted method demonstrated a bidirectional causal relationship between SLE and primary hypothyroidism. The odds ratio (OR) of SLE on primary hypothyroidism was 1.037 (95% CI, 1.013-1.061; P = 2.00 × 10-3) and that of primary hypothyroidism on SLE was 1.359 (95% CI, 1.217-1.520; P < 0.001). The OR of SLE on TSH was 1.007 (95% CI, 1.001-1.013; P = 0.032). However, TSH was not causally associated with SLE (P = 0.152). Similar results were found using different MR methods. In addition, colocalization analysis suggested that shared causal variants existed between SLE and primary hypothyroidism. The results of the validation analysis indicated a bidirectional causal relationship between SLE and primary hypothyroidism, as well as shared loci.In summary, a bidirectional causal relationship between SLE and primary hypothyroidism was observed with complementary genetic approaches.© The Author(s) 2022.

We aim to test whether hypothyroidism is causally associated with the risk of HCC by using Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis.Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with hypothyroidism were screened via a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 337,159 individuals of European descent (16,376 cases and 320,783 controls). The SNPs associated with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) were selected from a GWAS of 72,167 individuals of European descent. Summary-level data for HCC (168 cases and 372,016 controls) were extracted from UK Biobank. An inverse-variance-weighted (IVW) method was used as the primary MR analysis. Sensitivity analyses were examined via MR-Egger regression, heterogeneity test, pleiotropy test, and leave-one-out sensitivity test. The assumption that exposure causes outcome was verified using the MR Steiger test.Two-Sample MR analysis showed inverse associations between genetically predicted hypothyroidism and HCC risk (OR = 0.997, 95% CI, 0.995-0.999; P = 0.016). There were no statistical indications of heterogeneity among instruments (P-het = 0.667). Across five MR methods, genetically predicted hypothyroidism shows a consistent correlation with HCC. The leave-one-out analysis indicated that no single SNP changed the overall estimate (P = 0.016). In addition, the MR Steiger test revealed that hypothyroidism was causal for HCC and not the opposite (P = 0.000). Finally, there was no evidence for a direct causal effect of TSH level and FT4 level on HCC risk.Our results provide some that genetically determined hypothyroidism decreases the risk of HCC, although the size of the causal estimate is small. Further research is required to comprehend the mechanisms underlying this putative causative association, and follow-up clinical trials need to be conducted to establish whether inducing hypothyroidism could be beneficial for patients who are suffering from HCC. During future treatment of hypothyroidism, close attention to liver function may also be required to prevent a possible increased risk of HCC.Copyright © 2022 Lu, Wan, Li and Sun.',\n",

Genome-wide association studies of susceptibility (cases = 38 984; controls = 1 644 784), hospitalization (cases: 9986 = controls = 1 877 672), and very severe disease (cases = 5101; controls = 1 383 241) of COVID-19 were used as the outcome. We used the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method as the primary analysis, and utilized MR-Egger regression, weighted median, and robust adjusted profile score (RAPS) for sensitivity analysis. Genetic predisposition to higher serum levels of FT4 within the normal range was negatively associated with the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization (odds ratio [OR] = 0.818; 95% CI, 0.718-0.932; P = 2.6 × 10-3) and very severe disease (OR = 0.758; 95% CI, 0.626-0.923; P = 5.8 × 10-3), but not susceptibility. There is no evidence that genetically predicted circulating TSH levels are associated with COVID-19 susceptibility and severity risk. Neither apparent pleiotropy nor heterogeneity were detected in the sensitivity analysis. In summary, we found that higher FT4 levels may reduce the risk of COVID-19 severity, suggesting that thyroid function testing may be required for patients with COVID-19.© The Author(s) 2022.

Host genetic liability to hospitalized or severe COVID-19 was not associated with thyroid dysfunction or thyroid hormone levels.

Additionally, genetically predicted TSH levels were associated with HF (odds ratio = 0.82; 95% CI = 0.68-0.99,P = 0.042), PHD (odds ratio = 0.75; 95% CI = 0.32-0.82,P = 0.006), stroke (odds ratio = 0.95; 95% CI = 0.81-0.97,P = 0.007). However, genetically predicted thyroid function traits were not associated with EHTN and MI.Our study suggests FT4 and TSH are associated with cardiometabolic diseases, underscoring the importance of the pituitary-thyroid-cardiac axis in cardiometabolic health susceptibility.Copyright and License information: Journal of Geriatric Cardiology 2022.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) and pernicious anemia (PA) often coexist, but the directionality is unknown. In a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, using summary statistics from large genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in Europeans (N\\xa0=\\u200949\\u2009269-755\\u2009406), we examined the genetic associations between thyroid function, PA and markers of erythropoiesis. We performed inverse variance weighted random-effects MR, several sensitivity MR analyses, and bidirectional MR and MR Steiger for directionality. AITD and PA were associated bidirectionally (P\\xa0≤\\u20098\\u2009×\\u200910-6). Neither euthyroid thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) nor free thyroxine (FT4) were causally associated with PA. One standard deviation (SD) increase in euthyroid FT4 regulated by genetic variants in deiodinases 1 and 2 genes (DIO1/DIO2), corresponding to low-normal free triiodothyronine (FT3) levels, was causally associated with a pernicious/macrocytic anemia pattern, i.e. decreased erythrocyte counts (rank-based inverse normal transformed β\\u2009=\\u2009-0,064 [95% confidence interval: -0,085, -0,044], P\\xa0=\\u20098\\u2009×\\u200910-10) and hemoglobin (-0.028 [-0.051, -0.005], P\\xa0=\\u20090.02) and increased mean corpuscular hemoglobin (0.058 [0.025, 0.091], P\\xa0=\\u20095\\u2009×\\u200910-4) and mean corpuscular volume levels (0.075 [0.052, 0.098], P\\xa0=\\u20091\\u2009×\\u200910-8). Meanwhile, subclinical hyperthyroidism mirrored that pattern. AITD was causally associated with increased erythrocyte distribution width (P\\xa0=\\u20090.007) and decreased reticulocyte counts (P\\xa0≤\\u20090.02), whereas high-normal FT4 regulated by DIO1/DIO2 variants was causally associated with decreased bilirubin (-0.039 (-0.064, -0.013), P\\xa0=\\u20090.003). In conclusion, the bidirectional association between AITD and PA suggests a shared heritability for these two autoimmune diseases. AITD was causally associated with impaired erythropoiesis and not autoimmune hemolysis. Additionally, in euthyroid individuals, local regulation of thyroid hormones by deiodinases likely plays a role in erythropoiesis.© The Author(s) 2022. Published by Oxford University Press.

       "  'Abstract': 'Background: Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune disease and is often accompanied by thyroid dysfunction. Understanding the potential causal relationship between PBC and thyroid dysfunction is helpful to explore the pathogenesis of PBC and to develop strategies for the prevention and treatment of PBC and its complications. Methods: We used a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) method to estimate the potential causal effect of PBC on the risk of autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4), hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and thyroid cancer (TC) in the European population. We collected seven datasets of PBC and related traits to perform a series MR analysis and performed extensive sensitivity analyses to ensure the reliability of our results. Results: Using a sensitivity analysis, we found that PBC was a risk factor for AITD, TSH, hypothyroidism, and TC with odds ratio (OR) of 1.002 (95% CI: 1.000-1.005, p = 0.042), 1.016 (95% CI: 1.006-1.027, p = 0.002), 1.068 (95% CI: 1.022-1.115, p = 0.003), and 1.106 (95% CI: 1.019-1.120, p = 0.042), respectively. Interestingly, using reverse-direction MR analysis, we also found that AITD had a significant potential causal association with PBC with an OR of 0.021 (p = 5.10E-4) and that the other two had no significant causal relation on PBC. Conclusion: PBC causes thyroid dysfunction, specifically as AITD, mild hypothyroidism, and TC. The potential causal relationship between PBC and thyroid dysfunction provides a new direction for the etiology of PBC.Copyright © 2021 Huang, Hou, Zou, Ye, Yu and Yang.',\n",

Then, the causal relationship between serum TSH and osteoporotic bone fracture risk was tested.A cross-sectional study was done among patients of European Caucasian ethnicity recruited in Tayside (Scotland, UK). Electronic medical records (EMRs) were used to identify patients and average serum TSH concentration and linked to genetic biobank data. Genetic associations were performed by linear and logistic regression models. One-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to test causality of serum TSH on bone fracture risk.Replication in 9,452 euthyroid individuals confirmed known loci previously reported. The 58 polymorphisms accounted for 11.08% of the TSH variation (p < 1e-04). TSH-GRS was directly associated with the risk of hypothyroidism with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.98 for the highest quartile compared to the first quartile (p = 2.2e-12). MR analysis of 5,599 individuals showed that compared with those in the lowest tertile of the TSH-GRS, men in the highest tertile had a decreased risk of osteoporotic bone fracture (OR = 0.59, p = 2.4e-03), while no difference in a similar comparison was observed in women (OR = 0.93, p = 0.61). Sensitivity analysis yielded similar results.EMRs linked to genomic data in large populations allow replication of GWAS discoveries without additional genotyping costs.

However, the causal association between either subclinical hyper- or hypothyroidism and the thyroid hormones with blood pressure (BP) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) is not clear. We aim to investigate this in a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free tetraiodothyronine (FT4), hyper- and hypothyroidism, and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb), from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), were selected as MR instrumental variables. SNPs-outcome (BP, CVD) associations were evaluated in a large-scale cohort, the Malmö Diet and Cancer Study (n = 29,298). Causal estimates were computed by inverse-variance weighted (IVW), weighted median, and MR-Egger approaches. Genetically increased levels of TSH were associated with decreased systolic BP and with a lower risk of atrial fibrillation. Hyperthyroidism and TPOAb were associated with a lower risk of atrial fibrillation. Our data support a causal association between genetically decreased levels of TSH and both atrial fibrillation and systolic BP. The lack of significance after Bonferroni correction and the sensitivity analyses suggesting pleiotropy, should prompt us to be cautious in their interpretation. Nevertheless, these findings offer mechanistic insight into the etiology of CVD. Further work into the genes involved in thyroid functions and their relation to cardiovascular outcomes may highlight pathways for targeted intervention.',\n",

We aim to test whether genetically predicted variation within the normal range of thyroid function and hypothyroidism is causally associated with the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods: Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses using genetic instruments are associated with normal range thyrotropin (TSH) and free thyroxine (fT4) levels. Secondary analyses included investigation of the role of hypothyroidism. Bidirectional MR was conducted to address the presence of a potential reverse causal association. Summary statistics were obtained from the ThyroidOmics Consortium involving up to 119,715 individuals and the latest AD genome-wide association study data including up to 71,880 cases. Results: MR analyses show an association between increased genetically predicted normal range TSH levels and a decreased risk of AD (p\\u2009=\\u20090.02). One standard deviation increased normal range TSH levels were associated with a decreased risk of AD in individuals younger than 50 years old (p\\u2009=\\u20090.04).

The present study aimed to investigate the potential causal relationship between thyroid status and cardiovascular disease and to characterize the metabolomic profile associated with thyroid status.Multi-cohort two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was performed utilizing genome-wide significant variants as instruments for standardized thyrotropin (TSH) and free thyroxine (fT4) within the reference range. Associations between TSH and fT4 and metabolic profile were investigated in a two-stage manner: associations between TSH and fT4 and the full panel of 161 metabolomic markers were first assessed hypothesis-free, then directional consistency was assessed through Mendelian randomization, another metabolic profile platform, and in individuals with biochemically defined thyroid dysfunction.Circulating TSH was associated with 52/161 metabolomic markers, and fT4 levels were associated with 21/161 metabolomic markers among 9432 euthyroid individuals (median age varied from 23.0 to 75.4\\u2009years, 54.5% women). Positive associations between circulating TSH levels and concentrations of very low-density lipoprotein subclasses and components, triglycerides, and triglyceride content of lipoproteins were directionally consistent across the multivariable regression, MR, metabolomic platforms, and for individuals with hypo- and hyperthyroidism. Associations with fT4 levels inversely reflected those observed with TSH. Among 91,810 CAD cases and 656,091 controls of European ancestry, per 1-SD increase of genetically determined TSH concentration risk of CAD increased slightly, but not significantly, with an OR of 1.03 (95% CI 0.99-1.07; p value 0.16), whereas higher genetically determined fT4 levels were not associated with CAD risk (OR 1.00 per SD increase of fT4; 95% CI 0.96-1.04; p value 0.59).Lower thyroid status leads to an unfavorable lipid profile and a somewhat increased cardiovascular disease risk.© 2021.

The inverse-variance weighted method was adopted as the main analysis.One SD increase in genetically determined TSH level within reference range was causally associated with a reduced risk of AD (odds ratio: 0.988; 95% CI, 0.977-0.998). A similar inverse association was observed in sex-specific analysis. The causal association was attenuated after adjustment for atrial fibrillation and blood pressure, suggesting they may mediate the causal pathway. A positive causal effect of AD on TSH level was detected only in male participants. This male-specific feedback loop may explain why the largest cohort study to date (Rotterdam Study) demonstrated a null observational association in men. Null association was observed between FT4 level and AD in both directions.Genetic predisposition to increased TSH level, even within reference range, may lower the risk of AD, with atrial fibrillation, systolic, and diastolic blood pressure as possible mediators. Given the higher magnitude of risk reduction observed in the Rotterdam Study, whether the causal estimates derived from this MR study are underestimated warrants further investigation.© The Author(s) 2021.

       "  'Abstract': 'Background: Observational studies suggest that even minor variations in thyroid function are associated with the risk of mood disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD). However, it is unknown whether these associations are causal or not. We used a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to investigate causal effects of minor variations in thyrotropin (TSH) and free thyroxine (fT4) levels on MDD and BD risk. Materials and Methods: We performed two-sample MR analyses using data from the largest publicly available genome-wide association studies on normal-range TSH (n\\u2009=\\u200954,288) and fT4 (n\\u2009=\\u200949,269) levels, MDD (170,756 cases, 329,443 controls) and BD (20,352 cases, 31,358 controls). Secondary MR analyses investigated the effects of TSH and fT4 levels on specific MDD and BD subtypes. Reverse MR was also performed to assess the effects of MDD and BD on TSH and fT4 levels. Results: There were no associations between genetically predicted TSH and fT4 levels and MDD risk, nor MDD subtypes and minor depressive symptoms. A one standard deviation increase in fT4 levels was nominally associated with an 11% decrease in the overall BD risk (odds ratio [OR]\\u2009=\\u20090.89, 95% confidence interval [CI]\\u2009=\\u20090.80-0.98, p\\u2009=\\u20090.022) and a 13% decrease in the BD type 1 risk (OR\\u2009=\\u20090.87, CI\\u2009=\\u20090.75-1.00, p\\u2009=\\u20090.047). In the reverse direction, genetic predisposition to MDD and BD was not associated with TSH nor fT4 levels. Conclusions: Variations in normal-range TSH and fT4 levels have no effects on the risk of MDD and its subtypes, and neither on minor depressive symptoms. This indicates that depressive symptoms should not be attributed to minor variations in thyroid function. Borderline associations with BD and BD type 1 risks suggest that further clinical studies should investigate the effect of thyroid hormone treatment in BD.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'A genetic predisposition to lower thyrotropin (TSH) levels is associated with increased atrial fibrillation (AF) risk through undefined mechanisms.Defining the genetic mediating mechanisms could lead to improved targeted therapies to mitigate AF risk.We used 2-sample mendelian randomization (MR) to test associations between TSH-associated single-nucleotide variations and 16 candidate mediators. We then performed multivariable mendelian randomization (MVMR) to test for a significant attenuation of the genetic association between TSH and AF, after adjusting for each mediator significantly associated with TSH.Four candidate mediators (free thyroxine, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and height) were significantly inversely associated with genetically predicted TSH after adjusting for multiple testing. In MVMR analyses, adjusting for height significantly decreased the magnitude of the association between TSH and AF from -0.12 (SE 0.02) occurrences of AF per SD change in height to -0.06 (0.02) (P\\u2005=\\u2005.005). Adjusting for the other candidate mediators did not significantly attenuate the association.The genetic association between TSH and increased AF risk is mediated, in part, by taller stature. Thus, some genetic mechanisms underlying TSH variability may contribute to AF risk through mechanisms determining height occurring early in life that differ from those driven by thyroid hormone-level elevations in later life.© The Author(s) 2021.

However, the underlying causal association has not been established.This work aimed to determine and analyze the causal association between serum TSH level and obesity-related traits (body mass index [BMI] and obesity).The latest genome-wide association studies (GWASs) on TSH, BMI, and obesity were searched to obtain full statistics. Bidirectional 2-sample mendelian randomization (MR) was performed to explore the causal relationship between serum TSH and BMI and obesity. The inverse variance-weighted (IVW) and MR-Egger methods were used to combine the estimation for each single-nucleotide variation (formerly single-nucleotide polymorphism). Based on the preliminary MR results, free thyroxine (fT4) and free 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (fT3) levels were also set as outcomes to further analyze the impact of BMI on them. BMI and obesity were treated as the outcomes to evaluate the effect of serum TSH on them, and TSH was set as the outcome to estimate the effect of BMI and obesity on it.IVW and MR-Egger results both indicated that genetically driven serum TSH did not causally lead to changes in BMI or obesity. Moreover, the IVW method showed that the TSH level could be significantly elevated by genetically predicted high BMI (β\\u2005=\\u2005.038, SE\\u2005=\\u20050.013, P\\u2005=\\u2005.004).

       "  'Abstract': 'The endocrine and the immune systems interact by sharing receptors for hormones and cytokines, cross-control and feedback mechanisms. To date, no comprehensive study has assessed the impact of thyroid hormones on immune homeostasis. By studying immune phenotype (cell populations, antibody concentrations, circulating cytokines, adipokines and acute-phase proteins, monocyte-platelet interactions and cytokine production capacity) in two large independent cohorts of healthy volunteers of Western European descent from the Human Functional Genomics Project (500FG and 300BCG cohorts), we identified a crucial role of the thyroid hormone thyroxin (T4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) on the homeostasis of lymphocyte populations. TSH concentrations were strongly associated with multiple populations of both effector and regulatory T cells, whereas B-cell populations were significantly associated with free T4 (fT4). In contrast, fT4 and TSH had little impact on myeloid cell populations and cytokine production capacity. Mendelian randomization further supported the role of fT4 for lymphocyte homeostasis. Subsequently, using a genomics approach, we identified genetic variants that influence both fT4 and TSH concentrations and immune responses, and gene set enrichment pathway analysis showed enrichment of fT4-affected gene expression in B-cell function pathways, including the CD40 pathway, further supporting the importance of fT4 in the regulation of B-cell function. In conclusion, we show that thyroid function controls the homeostasis of the lymphoid cell compartment. These findings improve our understanding of the immune responses and open the door for exploring and understanding the role of thyroid hormones in the lymphocyte function during disease.© 2021 The Authors.

Over the last two decades, multiple genetic variants have been associated with variations in normal range thyroid function tests. Most recently, a large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) doubled the number of known variants associated with normal range thyrotropin (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) levels.This review summarizes the results of genetic association studies on normal range thyroid function and explores how these genetic variants can be used in future studies to improve our understanding of thyroid hormone regulation and disease.Serum TSH and FT4 levels are determined by multiple genetic variants on virtually all levels of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis. Functional follow-up studies on top of GWAS hits has the potential to discover new key players in thyroid hormone regulation, as exemplified by the identification of the thyroid hormone transporter SLC17A4 and the metabolizing enzyme AADAT. Translational studies may use these genetic variants to investigate causal associations between thyroid function and various outcomes in Mendelian Randomization (MR) studies, to identify individuals with an increased risk of thyroid dysfunction, and to predict the individual HPT axis setpoint.Recent genetic studies have greatly improved our understanding of the genetic basis of thyroid function, and have revealed novel pathways involved in its regulation. In addition, these findings have paved the way for various lines of research that can improve our understanding of thyroid hormone regulation and thyroid diseases, as well as the potential use of these markers in future clinical practice.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Endocrine Society 2020.',\n",

We conducted a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to examine the causality of the association between TSH and eGFR.10,603 participants were recruited from the Survey on Prevalence in East China for Metabolic Diseases and Risk Factors (SPECT-China), which was performed in 23 sites in East China during 2014-2016. We constructed weighted genetic risk scores (GRS) for TSH based on three TSH-related single nucleotide polymorphisms. eGFR was calculated using the CKD Epidemiology Collaboration formula. The instrumental variable (IV) was used to explore the causal relationship between TSH and eGFR.Higher measured TSH levels were associated with lower eGFR (B -0.717, 95%CI -0.958, -0.476) after multivariable adjustment. However, by MR analysis, per SD increase in the TSH_GRS was significantly associated with TSH (B 0.155, 95%CI 0.076, 0.235, P< 0.001) but not with eGFR (B -0.127, 95%CI -0.364, 0.110). Using IV estimator, no causal associations were observed for genetically instrumented TSH with eGFR.By a genetic approach that limits residual confounding and reverse causation in observational conventional epidemiological studies, TSH and eGFR are not causally associated, which suggests genetically elevated TSH concentrations may not affect the renal function.© 2018 The Author(s).

       "  'Abstract': 'With population aging, prevalence of low bone mineral density (BMD) and associated fracture risk are increased. To determine whether low circulating thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels within the normal range are causally related to BMD, we conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study. Furthermore, we tested whether common genetic variants in the TSH receptor (TSHR) gene and genetic variants influencing expression of TSHR (expression quantitative trait loci [eQTLs]) are associated with BMD. For both analyses, we used summary-level data of genomewide association studies (GWASs) investigating BMD of the femoral neck (n\\u2009=\\u200932,735) and the lumbar spine (n\\u2009=\\u200928,498) in cohorts of European ancestry from the Genetic Factors of Osteoporosis (GEFOS) Consortium. For the MR study, we selected 20 genetic variants that were previously identified for circulating TSH levels in a GWAS meta-analysis (n\\u2009=\\u200926,420). All independent genetic instruments for TSH were combined in analyses for both femoral neck and lumbar spine BMD. In these studies, we found no evidence that a genetically determined 1-standard deviation (SD) decrease in circulating TSH concentration was associated with femoral neck BMD (0.003 SD decrease in BMD per SD decrease of TSH; 95% CI, -0.053 to 0.048; p\\u2009=\\u20090.92) or lumbar spine BMD (0.010 SD decrease in BMD per SD decrease of TSH; 95% CI, -0.069 to 0.049; p\\u2009=\\u20090.73). A total of 706 common genetic variants have been mapped to the TSHR locus and expression loci for TSHR. However, none of these genetic variants were associated with BMD at the femoral neck or lumbar spine. In conclusion, we found no evidence for a causal effect of circulating TSH on BMD, nor did we find any association between genetic variation at the TSHR locus or expression thereof and BMD. © 2018 The Authors.

       "  'Abstract': 'To clarify the role of thyroid function in ischemic heart disease (IHD) we assessed IHD risk and risk factors according to genetically predicted thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4) and thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) positivity. Separate-sample instrumental variable analysis with genetic instruments (Mendelian randomization) was used in an extensively genotyped case (n\\u2009=\\u200964,374)-control (n\\u2009=\\u2009130,681) study, CARDIoGRAMplusC4D. Associations with lipids, diabetes and adiposity were assessed using the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium Results (n\\u2009=\\u2009196,475), the DIAbetes Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis case (n\\u2009=\\u200934,380)-control (n\\u2009=\\u2009114,981) study, and the Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits (body mass index in 152,893 men and 171,977 women, waist-hip ratio in 93,480 men and 116,741 women). Genetically predicted thyroid function was not associated with IHD (odds ratio (OR) per standard deviation for TSH 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97 to 1.12; for FT4 1.01, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.12; for TPOAb positivity 1.10, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.46) or after Bonferroni correction with risk factors, except for an inverse association of FT4 with low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol. The associations were generally robust to sensitivity analyses using a weighted median method and MR Egger. This novel study provides little indication that TSH, FT4 or TPOAb positivity affects IHD, despite potential effects on its risk factors.',\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'Increasing evidence suggests an association between thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (fT4), and deiodinases with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D).We examined whether TSH and fT4 levels and deiodinases are causally associated with insulin resistance and T2D, using Mendelian randomization.We selected 20 genetic variants for TSH level and four for fT4 level (identified in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of European-ancestry cohorts) as instrumental variables for TSH and fT4 levels, respectively. We used summary data from GWASs on the outcomes T2D [Diabetes, Genetics Replication and Meta-analysis (DIAGRAM), n = 12,171 cases and n = 56,862 control subjects] and glycemic traits in patients without diabetes [Meta-Analyses of Glucose and Insulin-Related Traits Consortium (MAGIC), n = 46,186 for fasting glucose and insulin and n = 46,368 for hemoglobin A1c]. To examine whether the associations between TSH/fT4 levels and the study outcomes were causal, we combined the effects of the genetic instruments. Furthermore, we examined the associations among 16 variants in DIO1, DIO2, DIO3, and T2D and glycemic traits.We found no evidence for an association between the combined genetic instrumental variables for TSH and fT4 and the study outcomes. For example, we did not observe a genetically determined association between high TSH level and T2D (odds ratio, 0.91 per standard deviation TSH increase; 95% confidence interval, 0.78 to 1.07). Selected genetic variants in DIO1 (e.g., rs7527713) were associated with measures of insulin resistance.We found no evidence for a causal association between circulatory levels of TSH and fT4 with insulin resistance and T2D, but we found suggestive evidence that DIO1 affects glucose metabolism.Copyright © 2017 by the Endocrine Society',\n",
